# The Brief:

My first Android application built with Kotlin. 

## Description

Time Fighter keeps track of how many times a user can press a button in the time limit given (1 minute). The user's score and the time remaining survive configuration changes (e.g. rotating the device).

The project was built by following a tutorial from raywenderlich.com.
